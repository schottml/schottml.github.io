Hello! Welcome to my website!

---

## Purpose

The purpose of this site is to serve as a living record of my work on ongoing projects as well as a curated repository of descriptions of previous projects. Not everything that I work on is deserving of a place on this site, so if you're brave enough to bear some truly atrocious code, all of my projects, both good and ugly, will be available through my [personal GitHub](https://github.com/FishmanDefender) page. You may notice that I also have a [curated GitHub](https://github.com/schottml), which I'll also use to highlight projects that I'm particularly proud of.

Please, look around and feel free to contact me if you have any questions!

## Under Construction

Please pardon the dust and debris everywhere, we're still under construction. Don't let that deter you, though! Please, feel free to look around. If you'd like to help, let me know if you find any loose wires or dead links and I'll be sure to patch things up!
