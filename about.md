# About Me

I am a third year grad student in physics at the University of Arizona. My research interests include the use of machine learning algorithms and big data processing techniques to investigate physics phenomena ranging from the evolution of structure in the early universe to the detection and characterization of dark matter particle candidates.

Having spent over a decade in Boy Scouts and being an Eagle Scout, I enjoy most kinds of outdoor activities, especially hiking, camping, fishing, and kayaking. Though I don't get out as much as I used to, I still swear that little else can beat a good camping trip.

I borrowed a SONY α58 DSLR for an elective in photojournalism that I took back as an undergraduate. I fell in love with the art of photography so quickly that I picked up a SONY α58 for myself. Ever since then, I've been shooting whenever the chance presents itself. <!--I've included some of what I think are half-decent shots for an amateur down on the "pictures" page for anyone adventurous enough to look. -->

As an adamant technophile, it would be remiss of me not to mention that I also hobby in computer hardware. Having assembled three new desktops and repaired a fourth, I'm always on the lookout for another computer build. Though it's not currently in the budget, I'd like to some day build and run my own dedicated home server, even if it's for no other reason than just saying that I managed to get it working.
