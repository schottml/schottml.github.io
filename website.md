# Personal Website

Yes! It's true! The very site you're on right now is one of my projects!

Because this project is still under construction, all dev notes will be posted here. Unfortunately, since I'm not quite familiar with Jekyll's "post" system yet, I'll just be keeping a list of things to do here until I have that system up and running.

## Summary

**TODO**
- [ ] Navbar
- [ ] Navbar Dropdown
- [ ] Headshot
- [ ] Posts

## Project Plan

Because I need to put this somewhere, I'll put it here.

The overall plan for this site is to act as a live update platform for all of my research and professional projects. I may some day add personal projects or create a separate site for those, but let's keep things simple here for now. The basic components for this that still need to be implemented are as follows.

- The **Navbar** needs to be tweaked still. Once the CSS for that is done and working, then I can start adding other pages.
- This navbar also requires a **dropdown menu** for "Projects".
- I need a **headshot** for the header column. This is, unfortunately, dependent on me remembering my camera.
- Update the **header description** to include my work address, work number, and email.
- Get **posts** working. This will be my method for updating projects. [link](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/posts/). The format will be blog-like, with a page containing links to all previous posts in reverse chronological order.
