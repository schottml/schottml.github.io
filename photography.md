# Photography

As I mentioned in my [About Page](about.md), I'm a big fan of photography. Though I don't shoot super often, I do enjoy it when I get the change. I currently use the stock SONY Î±58 18-55mm variable lens and a fixed 55mm f/1.8 lens. If I had to choose a favorite subject to shoot, right now I'd have to go with crowds and large events simply because nature shots are so much more fun to get when you have a telephoto lens (which will be my next "big upgrade").

Though I have a lot more pictures than the ones below, these pictures are some of my favorite shots.
